  ## Description

  Just Another Text Editor, or J.A.T.E for short, is an in browser text editor that meets the PWA criteria. The data on this app persists, meaning that any text you add to this text editor will remain despite anything happening to your browser such as closing the editor or being offline. Being a PWA, this app is also installable.

  AS A developer
  I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
  SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

  GIVEN a text editor web application
  WHEN I open my application in my editor
  THEN I should see a client server folder structure
  WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
  THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
  WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
  THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
  WHEN I run my webpack plugins
  THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
  WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
  THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
  WHEN I open the text editor
  THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
  WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
  WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
  WHEN I click on the Install button
  THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
  WHEN I load my web application
  THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
  WHEN I register a service worker
  THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
  WHEN I deploy to Render
  THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
